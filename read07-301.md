# REST :

From what I understand of this article **polymorphism** applies to **REST** by saying that we can have **multiple** nouns, ie things to be **selected** that have the same **verb** applied to them I.E.

1. **POST**
2. **GET**
3. **PUT**
4. **DELETE**.

Representational state transfer is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP. It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services. A Web service that follows these guidelines is called RESTful. Such a Web service must provide its Web resources in a textual representation and allow them to be read and modified with a stateless protocol and a predefined set of operations.

it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

**The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to**.

A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser Those URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.

Which relate to **SQL** with :

1. **INSERT**
2. **SELECT**
3. **UPDATE**
4. **DELETE**.
