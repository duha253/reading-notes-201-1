### Heroku Defining 

- Heroku lets you **deploy**, **run** and **manage** applications written in Ruby, **Node.js**, Java, Python, Clojure, Scala, Go and PHP.
- **Dependency mechanism**s vary across languages: in Ruby you use a Gemfile, in Python a requirements.txt, in **Node.js a package.json**, in Java a pom.xml and so on.


- Heroku is a **polyglot[speaking, many languages.]** platform it lets you:
  - **build**
  - **run**
  - **scale** applications in a similar manner across all the languages
  - utilizing the **dependencies** and Procfile.
    - The Procfile exposes an architectural aspect of your application

    ### How can I?

1. We will use **Node.js** for our project.
   1. is an **open source**
   1. **cross-platform runtime environment**
   1. allows you to **build server-side**
   1. **networking applications**.

### Pretty simple, but it's a server!

First of all, we need to **create a JavaScript file**. Let's name it **server.js**:

```var http = require("http");

http.createServer( function( request, response) {

response.writeHead( 200, {"Content-Type": "text/plain"} );

response.write( "It's alive!" );

response.end();

}).listen(3000);

```

## It's Heroku time!

1. Open your terminal within your project folder. For my Linux it's:
   `cd/path/to/my/project`
1. Then run: `git init` Empty Git repository will be initialized in .git/ folder.
1. Then run: `git add .` This command allows Git to track your files changes.
1. Now commit your files to the initialized Git repo: `git commit -m "Simple server functionality added"`
1. **We'll create our first Heroku application now:**
   `heroku create`
   Heroku will **generate a random name** for your application.
1. Now we can deploy our project. Every **Heroku app starts with no branches and no code**. So, the first time we deploy our project, we need to specify a remote branch to push to:
   `git push heroku master`
1. The application is now deployed. Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running:
   `heroku ps:scale web=1`
1. And now, before we open it, it's time to choose a proper name for our first creation. I called it myfirstserver:
   `heroku apps:rename myfirstserver`
1. Everything is done. You can try it now:
   `heroku open`



## live server very cool fast and its on the cloud and you can make as many branches as you can:



1. create repo on github clone it to the pc
2. deploy and test the server from my machine (data rout send json data/ static files*index.html* served from public )
3. open repo on pc and create file server.js
4. on the terminal run :
   1. **npm init -y (it will create a file called package.json)**
   2. **npm install express (its like jQuery to help server my app depends on express)**
   3. **cat package.json (your server details)**
   4. **ls -al (list of files in the folder)**

**to get express in its going to be required**
`const express = require("express");`

**express is actually a function**
server has alot of methods to help us
`const server = express();`

**local host (tell express which port to use)**
PORT writen capitalized b/c whe we will go to herouku it will have many ports (just to know it)
process.env.PORT special thing in node(given by heroku for free)
the next line means (use what heruku gives U or use 3000)
`const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;`

**make rout (which is look like jQuery get(event listener) )**

```server.get("/test", (Request, Response) => {
Response.send("your test worked");
});
```

**build another Rout called Data**

```server.get("/data", (Request, Response) => {
let family = [{ name: "bebo" }, { name: "nma2" }, { name: "mum" }];
Response.json(family);
});
```

**static file from public jordan.html**
`server.use(express.static("./public"));`

to test it go to terminal and stop the server (clt+c) and start it again npm start
**go to browser and type http://localhost:3000/test**
**go to browser and type http://localhost:3000/data**
**go to browser and type http://localhost:3000/jordan.html**

**server has listen**

```server.listen(PORT, () =>
console.log("listining to the port or on port", PORT)
);
```

on terminal typ `npm start` (the msg shown will be the msg inside the console)

```http//localhost:3000/data(its called path or rout)
 /data (its called path or rout)
```



- create an account on heroku.com
- create an app
- deploy the app from github
