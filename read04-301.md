## A Complete Guide to Grid

**CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system.**

**Properties for the Parent (Grid Container)**

- **display**
  - Values:
    grid - generates a block-level grid
    inline-grid - generates an inline-level grid
- **grid-template-columns/ grid-template-rows**
  - Values:
    <track-size> - can be a length, a percentage, or a fraction of the free space in the grid (using the fr unit)
    <line-name> - an arbitrary name of your choosing
- **grid-template-areas**
  - Values:
    <grid-area-name> - the name of a grid area specified with grid-area
    . - a period signifies an empty grid cell
    none - no grid areas are defined
- **grid-template** - Values:
  none - sets all three properties to their initial values
  <grid-template-rows> / <grid-template-columns> - sets grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to the specified values, respectively, and sets grid-template-areas to none
  etc...


  **Properties for the Children (Grid Items)**

- **grid-column-start/ grid-column-end/ grid-row-start/ grid-row-end**
  - Values:
    <line> - can be a number to refer to a numbered grid line, or a name to refer to a named grid line
    span <number> - the item will span across the provided number of grid tracks
    span <name> - the item will span across until it hits the next line with the provided name
    auto - indicates auto-placement, an automatic span, or a default span of one
- **grid-column/ grid-row** - Values:
  <start-line> / <end-line> - each one accepts all the same values as the longhand version, including span
  etc..

_grid-column-start property._
_grid-column-end property._
_If you want to count grid lines from the right instead of the left, you can give grid-column-start and grid-column-end negative values. For example, you can set it to **-1** to specify the **first grid line** from the **right**._


## Regex

**Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text**

**Summary**
As you’ve seen, the application fields of regex can be multiple and I’m sure that you’ve recognized at least one of these tasks among those seen in your developer career, here a quick list:

1. data validation (for example check if a time string i well-formed)
1. data scraping (especially web scraping, find all pages that contain a certain set of words eventually in a specific order)
1. data wrangling (transform data from “raw” to another format)
1. string parsing (for example catch all URL GET parameters, capture text inside a set of parenthesis)
1. string replacement (for example, even during a code session using a common IDE to translate a Java or C# class in the respective JSON object — replace “;” with “,” make it lowercase, avoid type declaration, etc.)
1. syntax highlightning, file renaming, packet sniffing and many other applications involving strings (where data need not be textual)
