### What is SQL? :interrobang:

- **Structured Query Language**
- is a **language** designed to allow both technical and non-technical users **query**, **manipulate**, and **transform data** from a relational database.
- due to its _simplicity_, SQL databases provide _safe_ and _scalable storage_ for millions of websites and mobile applications.


- SQL stands for Structured Query Language
- SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
- SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.

```There are many popular SQL databases including

1. SQLite
2. MySQL
3. Postgres
4. Oracle
5. Microsoft SQL Server.

All of them support the common SQL language standard, but each implementation can differ in the additional features and storage types it supports.

## What Can SQL do?
 - SQL can execute queries against a database
   - SQL can retrieve data from a database
     - SQL can insert records in a database
       - SQL can update records in a database
           - SQL can delete records from a database
             - SQL can create new databases
            - SQL can create new tables in a database
          - SQL can create stored procedures in a database
        - SQL can create views in a database
      - SQL can set permissions on tables, procedures, and views

### Relational databases 
Before learning the SQL syntax, it's important to have a model for what a relational database actually is. A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

**we can save the info from the cloud at the DB(DataBase) :card_index_dividers: to use it quieckly**
