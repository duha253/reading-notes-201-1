# CSS transform

### Definition and Usage
The transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.


### 2D Transforms
Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes.

CSS transforms allow you to move, rotate, scale, and skew elements.Mouse over the element below to see a 2D transformation.

#### With the CSS transform property you can use the following 2D transformation methods:

**translate()
rotate()
scaleX()
scaleY()
scale()
skewX()
skewY()
skew()
matrix()**



**The translate() Method**

The translate() method moves an element from its current position (according to the parameters given for the X-axis and the Y-axis).


### 3D Transforms#three dimensional transforms
Working with two-dimensional transforms we are able to alter elements on the horizontal and vertical axes, however there is another axis along which we can transform elements. 



## Combining Transforms
It is common for multiple transforms to be used at once, rotating and scaling the size of an element at the same time for example. In this event multiple transforms can be combined together. To combine transforms, list the transform values within the transform property one after the other without the use of commas.


## What are CSS Animations?

An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want.To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation. Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.


**Note: The animation-duration property defines how long time an animation should take to complete. If the animation-duration property is not specified, no animation will occur, because the default value is 0s (0 seconds)**.






## Fade in
_Having things fade in is a fairly common request from clients It’s a great way to emphasize functionality or draw attention to a call to action,Fade in effects are coded in two steps: first, you set the initial state; next, you set the change_.

## Grow & Shrink
_To grow an element, you used to have to use its width and height, or its padding, But now we can use CSS3’s transform to enlarge_.


## Change color
_Animating a change of color used to be unbelievably complex, with all kinds of math involved in calculating separate RGB values and then recombining them_.


## 3D shadow
_3D shadows were frowned upon for a year or so, because they weren’t seen as compatible with flat design, which is of course nonsense, they work fantastically well to give a user feedback on their interactions and work with flat, or fake 3D interfaces_.


## Swing
_Not all elements use the transition property. We can also create highly complex animations using @keyframes, animation and animation-iteration.In this case, we’ll first define a CSS animation in your styles. You’ll notice that due to implementation issues, we need to use @-webkit-keyframes as well as @keyframes (yes, Internet Explorer really is better than Chrome, in this respect at least)_.
