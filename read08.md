#### Screen Size

#### CSS Frameworks

CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.


## Summary

**_LAYOUT_**

1. <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

2.  Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

3. The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-columnlayouts.  (Floated items require a defined width.)

4. Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

5. Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

6. Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

7. Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

8. CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

9. CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

10.  You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
